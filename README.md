## Why assign?
The linux ubuntu will read usb device sequencially as you plug in, e.g. you have 2 ttyUSBx devices, one for the camera and another one for the servo, if you plug in the camera and the servo respectively, the ubuntu will read camera as ttyUSB0 and servo as ttyUSB1. On the other hand, if you do opposite way, you will read servo as ttyUSB0 and camera as ttyUSB1. To prevent this happens, there is a method to assign a static port on linux ubuntu, of course, there is also for Windows and Mac but this is for the linux only.

## steps to assign /dev/ttyUSBx
_these are steps for assigning the **ttyUSBx**, for ttyACMx, there is a little change which will be after this._
1. Plug in the device
2. check that if linux reads the device or not using command in the terminal, this should show all ttyUSBx devices you plugged in
```
ls -l /dev/ttyUSB*
```
3. Check the port detail using **udevadm**, this will show attributes of device you plugged in, the _x_ is the number of port you plugged in, in this case, it can be from 0, 1, 2, 3 and so on
```
udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyUSBx --attribute-walk
```
4. once you enter, look for the line that is written like below, at this point, I assume that you know what are PID, VID and Serial of device
```
ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403"
ATTRS{serial}=="FTYS6KQ7"
```
5. After you get the detail of the port, then head to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and create the `10-usb-serial.rules` file , and use your favorite editor to edit this file
```
cd /etc/udev/rules.d/
```
```
touch 10-usb-serial.rules
```
6. Open up the `10-usb-serial.rules` and type the following, replace the attribute PID, VID and the serial you found from step number 4, then use your custom name  for your USB device e.g. ttyUSB_CAMERA1, ttyUSB_CAMERA2 or anything else you feel comfortable with. This could be more than 1 line of code if you have multiple devices connected and want to assign a static port to every connected device
```
KERNEL=="ttyUSB*", ATTRS{idProduct}=="6001", ATTRS{idVendor}=="0403", ATTRS{serial}=="FTYS6KQ7", SYMLINK+="YOURNAME"
```
7. After finish the code, save the file and trigger the udevadm to allow our mapping take effect
```
sudo udevadm trigger
```
8. Check the USB port again, and it should show something like this. If your mapping does not show, try reboot the ubuntu, if it does not appear like below again, it means that you must have a typo in the `10-usb-serial.rules`
```
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 188, 0 11æœˆ  2 12:24 /dev/ttyUSB0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root         7 11æœˆ  2 12:24 YOURNAME -> ttyUSB0
```

## for the ttyACMx
steps are all the same but the command is a bit different, I will have only a command except the explainations
1. Plug in the device
2. Check port
```
ls -l /dev/tty/USB*
```
3. Check port attributes
```
udevadm info --name=/dev/ttyACMx --attribute-walk
```
4. Look for the following attributes
```
ATTRS{idProduct}=="0043"
ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341"
ATTRS{serial}=="75232302221E05110"
```
5. Head to `/etc/udev/rules.d/` and create the `10-usb-serial.rules` file, if you already have, do not need to create
6. Open up and type, save and exit
```
KERNEL=="ttyACM*", ATTRS{idProduct}=="0043", ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341", ATTRS{serial}=="75232302221E05110", SYMLINK+="YOURNAME"
```
7. Trigger mapping to take effect, or reboot the ubuntu
```
udevadm control --reload-rules
```
8. After reboot, check the port using `ls -l /dev/ttyACM*`, if it appears like below, it is correct, if not, check the mapping file again
```
crw-rw---- 1 root dialout 166, 0 11æœˆ  2 12:25 /dev/ttyACM0
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root         7 11æœˆ  2 12:24 YOURNAME -> ttyACM0
```

P.S. The name you are going to re-assign should be the name that it is easy to remember and use ! otherwise, you might get confuse with what you just re-assgin

## For USB camera in ROS
If you want to use USB camera in ROS, [libuvc]([https://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera](https://github.com/libuvc/libuvc)https://github.com/libuvc/libuvc) provides [libvuc_camera](https://wiki.ros.org/libuvc_camera) integrated ROS integrated that have some great features:
1. Dynamic reconfiguration and monitoring of the camera's control settings
2. Camera calibration [camera_info_manager](https://wiki.ros.org/camera_info_manager)
3. Image pipeline integration [image_transport](https://wiki.ros.org/image_transport)

ðŸŸ¢ Tested on Linux Ubuntu 20, ROS Noetic

How to integrated ROS interface with your USB camera
1. Install some important packages
```
sudo apt install ros-noetic-rgbd-launch libuvc-dev
```
```
sudo apt install ros-noetic-libuvc-camera
```
2. Give permission (chmod) to camera by specifying the product and vendor IDs of your USB
4.
